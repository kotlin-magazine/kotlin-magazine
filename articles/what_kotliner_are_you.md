Count your numbers of '●', '▲', '■' and '◆'.

### You have a majority of '■': You are a **multiplatform enthusiast**.

Write once, run everywhere! This has been the Holy Grail of the software industry for the last 50 years and with Kotlin you have finally found it! You deploy to multiple app stores from CI and are at peak productivity. You never lose an opportunity to showcase the latest Fleet features to your iOS colleagues and discuss the merits of Kotlin on the backend. You're looking forward to Swift interop and wasm to integrate even better in those ecosystems. The future is bright!

### You have a majority of '●': You are a **functional purist**.

A language is only as good as its mathematical foundations! You avoid mutable state like the plague and like your functions pure. You love that Kotlin comes with a non-turing complete type system and high order functions. You're dreaming of a world without bugs where programs can be proven at build time. And who knows, with Kotlin, this might happen sooner than expected!

### You have a majority of '▲': You are a **pragmatic crafter**.

A good workman looks after his tools! Kotlin is simply the best tool for your job. You love the top-notch IDE integration, the rich ecosystem, the expressive language and the always resourceful community. You know all the IntelliJ/Android Studio shortcuts by heart and when it comes to debugging, you're not afraid of single stepping and using conditional breakpoints. The only thing slowing you down was compilation times but you already have a K2 branch ready to merge. Really there's not much to improve... Except maybe those AI bots that could automate things even more ?...       

### You have a majority of '◆': You are a **curious polyglot**.

Kotlin is not your main language. Maybe you've been doing Java for a while and heard about this null safety thing in Kotlin. Or maybe you like to control your memory allocations and stay closer to your hardware, save every CPU cycle! In all cases, you recognize that different jobs need different tools and are eager to learn about different technologies and what they can bring. You like exploring things and venturing in new spaces. Maybe one day, you'll settle in Kotlin land...
