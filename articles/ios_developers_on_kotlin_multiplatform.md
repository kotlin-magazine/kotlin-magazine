# iOS Developers on Kotlin Multiplatform

We wanted to get an honest picture of what developers outside our Kotlin bubble think of Kotlin Multiplatform.
So what's better than just asking multiple iOS developers? That's exactly what we did!

We've asked them: "What’s your take on Kotlin Multiplatform?". Here are their responses:

> I am generally not a huge fan of cross-platform frameworks because they diminish the native experience both for users and developers. However, Kotlin Multiplatform is a great exception. It provides native performance with small overhead and as a developer you can choose how far to take it. It is great for shared business logic and models under the hood, combined with native UI.

> KMP to me is the best cross-platform approach I have seen for a long time. It does not try to re-invent the wheel but builds on proven technology like LLVM, more importantly though: It never tries to work against the platforms, and allows the developers to concentrate on what they do best.
> &mdash; <cite>Alexander von Below</cite>

> My take on Kotlin Multiplatform is that it's a promising technology that addresses the challenges of code sharing across multiple platforms. It offers several advantages, including code reusability, improved maintainability, and potentially faster development cycles. However, like any technology, it also has its limitations and trade-offs, and its suitability depends on the specific requirements and constraints of each project. Overall, Kotlin Multiplatform can be a valuable tool for developers looking to build cross-platform applications efficiently.

> I was initially skeptical about using KMP, but I ended up liking using it for shared logic. Unlike other cross-platform options it allowed us to keep native performance while having a consistent behavior across platforms.

> Appreciating cross-platform code, we faced hurdles with KMP SDK. It inflated our iOS SDK size, making distribution problematic. Runtime crashes were tough to debug. For adoption, it should compile without needing a support library. KMP’s framework requirement, closed-source binary limits, and generated types like KotlinIterator and KotlinShort, which bloat the binary and complicate integration with other KMP apps, were significant concerns.
