# iOS Developers on Kotlin Multiplatform

We wanted to get an honest picture of what developers outside our Kotlin bubble think of Kotlin Multiplatform.
So what's better than just asking multiple iOS developers? That's exactly what we did!

We've asked them: "What’s your take on Kotlin Multiplatform?". Here are their responses:

> I am generally not a huge fan of cross-platform frameworks because they diminish the native experience both for users and developers. However, Kotlin Multiplatform is a great exception. It provides native performance with small overhead and as a developer you can choose how far to take it. It is great for shared business logic and models under the hood, combined with native UI.
