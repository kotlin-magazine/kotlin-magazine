# Magazine Intro

It's a great time to be a Kotlin developer. The new K2 compiler is finally stable. K2 brings a significant build performance upgrade, and it starts a new era: the development of new language features beyond Kotlin 2.0. With Google focussing on Kotlin first for Android and Compose, millions of developers have boarded the Kotlin train. Meanwhile, Kotlin Multiplatform has evolved to stable, and we are seeing more foundations and even big UI frameworks like Compose being made multiplatform-ready. And the exceptionally great IDEs by JetBrains make writing Kotlin a breeze. All of these not just increase the worth of your Kotlin code, but it also increases your worth as a Kotlin developer!

To top it all off, Kotlin has one of the best communities I have ever experienced. It's a great mix of kindness, high competence, approachability, fun, will to improve, and just the right touch of craziness.
Take this magazine for example. It started out as a vague idea to create just a cover as an April's joke, and when I told the idea to people from JetBrains at KotlinConf 2023 and earned laughter I knew we had to make it happen (check [kotlintoday.com](https://kotlintoday.com) if you haven't seen it yet). The idea grew. I thought: Wouldn't it be a nice surprise for people if we actually launched a real magazine just in time for KotlinConf 2024 - with actual content? Something tangible, which is not happening so often these days. We assembled a small team from the Kotlin community, with one mission: to build a magazine that we would enjoy reading ourselves. I can say I have never been more proud of the Kotlin community!

My gratitude goes to everyone who made this magazine possible: Thank you, you're amazing!

And to you, dear readers: No matter if you're just starting out with Kotlin (oh boy, you're in for a ride!) or a Kotlin pro: We hope that this magazine will bring joy to your hearts!

Enjoy the magazine, and have a nice Kotlin. And if you see one of us at KotlinConf: come say hi!
